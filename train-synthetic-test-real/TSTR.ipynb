    "# Train-Synthetic-Test-Real\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to assess synthetic data quality with respect to its utility for a downstream Machine Learning (ML) task. The demonstrated approach is also known as the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) evaluation [[1](#refs)]. It is a strong test for the quality of generated synthetic data, as machine learning models require deeper hidden structures being faithfully represented in order to be effective on new unseen data. Thus, it can serve as a stronger test than relying merely on assessing higher-level statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "See image below for the general setup of TSTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./TSTR.png' width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we take actual (=real) data, and split it into a holdout and a training dataset. Next, we create a synthetic dataset only based on the training data. Then we train a Machine Learning (ML) model, and do so once using the synthetic data and once using the actual training data. And finally we evaluate the performance of each of those two models on top of the actual holdout data, that was kept aside all along. By comparing the performance of these two models, we can assess how much utility has been retained by the synthesization method with respect to a specific ML task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that one needs to use a true holdout for the evaluation to properly measure out-of-sample performance, as this is the relevant metric for real-world use cases. If one uses the same training data that has been used for the synthesis, one would \"leak\" information from training into evaluation. This becomes particularly an issue for synthesizers that are prone to overfitting, and simply memorize the samples that it has been exposed to. If one, on the other hand, were to use synthetic data for the evaluation, one would not get meaningful results either, as the synthetic data might not be representative of the real data. E.g., consider the degenerate case of a synthesizer that only produces the same record over and over again. Any model trained on that data, would yield perfect results when evaluated on it again, whereas it will be of no use when applied to real data."

    "\n",
    "For the given dataset, and the given synthesizer, we can observe a near on-par performance of the synthetic data with respect to the given downstream ML task. This means, that one can train the model purely on synthetic data, and yield just as good results as if it were trained on real data, but without ever putting the privacy of any of the contained individuals at any risk.\n",

    "## Further exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to walking through the above instructions, we suggest..\n",
    "* to run Train-Synthetic-Test-Real \n",
    "  * using a different dataset, eg. the UCI bank-marketing dataset [[4](#refs)]\n",
    "  * using a different downstream ML model, eg. a RandomForest model [[5](#refs)]\n",
    "  * using a different synthesizer, eg. SynthCity, SDV, etc.\n",
    "* to check the impact of synthetic upsampling\n",
    "  * generate 10x or 100x the original data records, and see whether it improves ML accuracy"
