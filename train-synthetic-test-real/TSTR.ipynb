    "# Validate synthetic data via Train-Synthetic-Test-Real\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate the process of evaluating the quality of synthetic data based on its utility for a downstream Machine Learning (ML) task. The method is commonly referred to as the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) evaluation [[1](#refs)]. The TSTR evaluation serves as a robust measure of synthetic data quality because ML models rely on the accurate representation of deeper underlying patterns to perform effectively on previously unseen data. As a result, this approach offers a more reliable assessment than simply evaluating higher-level statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "See image below for the general setup of TSTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/TSTR.png' width=\"600px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we take actual (=real) data, and split it into a holdout and a training dataset. Next, we create a synthetic dataset only based on the training data. Then we train a Machine Learning (ML) model, and do so once using the synthetic data and once using the actual training data. And finally we evaluate the performance of each of those two models on top of the actual holdout data, that was kept aside all along. By comparing the performance of these two models, we can assess how much utility has been retained by the synthesization method with respect to a specific ML task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that one needs to use a true holdout for the evaluation to properly measure out-of-sample performance, as this is the relevant metric for real-world use cases. If one uses the same training data that has been used for the synthesis, one would \"leak\" information from training into evaluation. This becomes particularly an issue for synthesizers that are prone to overfitting, and simply memorize the samples that it has been exposed to. If one, on the other hand, were to use synthetic data for the evaluation, one would not get meaningful results either, as the synthetic data might not be representative of the real data. E.g., consider the degenerate case of a synthesizer that only produces the same record over and over again. Any model trained on that data, would yield perfect results when evaluated on it again, whereas it will be of no use when applied to real data."

    "For this tutorial, we will be using a cleaned up version of the UCI Adult Income [[2](#refs)] dataset, that itself stems from the 1994 American Community Survey [[3](#refs)] by the US census bureau. The dataset consists of 48,842 records, 14 mixed-type features and has 1 target variable, that indicates whether a respondent had or had not reported a high level of annual income. This dataset is being selected, as it's one of the go-to datasets commonly used to showcase machine learning models in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will synthesize `census-training.csv` which can be found [here](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/raw/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/census-training.csv) This is an 80% sample of the full dataset. The remaining 20% sample can be found [here](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/raw/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/census-holdout.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will automatically create a synthetic dataset using the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data Platform. Optionally, you can also download a previously synthesized version [here](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostly-tutorials/raw/dev/train-synthetic-test-real/census-synthetic.csv). If you want to use that you will need to modify the code to load that synthetic dataset accordingly.\n",

In both cases, the higher the metric, the better the predictive accuracy of the model.\n",

    "The displayed chart shows the distribution of scores, that the model assigned to each of the holdout records. A score close to 0 means that model is very confident, that the record is of low income. A score close to 1 means that the model is very confident that it's a high income record. These scores are further split by their actual outcome, i.e. whether they are or are not actually high income. This allows to visually inspect the model's confidence in assigning the right scores."

    "\n",
    "For the given dataset, and the given synthesizer, we can observe a near on-par performance of the synthetic data with respect to the given downstream ML task. This means, that one can train the model purely on synthetic data, and yield just as good results as if it were trained on real data, but without ever putting the privacy of any of the contained individuals at any risk.\n",

    "In addition to walking through the above instructions, we suggest..\n",

    "  * using a different dataset, eg. the UCI bank-marketing dataset [[4](#refs)]\n",
    "  * using a different downstream ML model, eg. a RandomForest model [[5](#refs)]\n",
    "  * using a different synthesizer, eg. SynthCity, SDV, etc.\n",
    "* to check the impact of synthetic upsampling\n",
    "  * generate 10x or 100x the original data records, and see whether it improves ML accuracy"
