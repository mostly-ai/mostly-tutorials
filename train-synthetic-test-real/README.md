# Train-Synthetic-Test-Real

In this tutorial, we show how to assess synthetic data quality with respect to its utility for a downstream Machine Learning (ML) task. The demonstrated 
approach is also known as the Train-Synthetic-Test-Real (TSTR) evaluation. It is a strong test for the quality of generated synthetic data, 
as machine learning models require deeper hidden structures being faithfully represented in order to be effective on new unseen data.
